# WITSocial
This is the main project for my Web-Based IT-Systems class at Roskilde University.

## What is it?
This is currently a work in progress, but the goal is to have created a sort of social media platform which shows the data (posts, users, comments and so on) from a database the course provides through a VPN.

## How is it made?

Languages: HTML, PHP, CSS

The course has an API which we use to get data from the courses database. Other than that it is HTML, PHP and CSS code that displays a very simple website.
