# WITSocial
This is the main project for my Web-Based IT-Systems class at Roskilde University.

## What is it?
The goal is to have created a sort of social media platform which shows the data (posts, users, comments and so on) from a database the course provides through a VPN.

## How is it made?
Languages: HTML, PHP, CSS and JavaScript

The course has an API which we use to get data from the courses database. Other than that it is HTML, PHP, CSS and JavaScript code that displays a very simple website. We then upload these php files to the university server and gain access to our websites through the http://wits.ruc.dk website.
